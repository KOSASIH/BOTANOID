# Description

Botanoid is a financial technology innovation that applies artificial intelligence to the problem of predatory lending. Predatory lending is the practice of making loans with unfair or deceptive terms, often to vulnerable borrowers. Predatory loans are often marked by large fees, hidden charges, and exorbitant interest rates.Citing research from an independent study conducted by the Harvard Business Review, Botanoid estimates that predatory lending costs households in the United States $16 billion per year—and one in five people are victims at some point in their lives.Botanoid is a complex piece of code that runs on a decentralized network of computers around the world. This software offers alternative financial services to individuals who have been rejected by traditional banks and credit unions due to bad credit or insufficient assets. The company has already developed a successful product: users can borrow up to $5,000 using Botanoid's credit scoring system, which uses advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to assess risk and return on investment for each individual user based on their social media profile, credit history, and transactional data from cryptocurrency exchanges.The company aims to eventually scale its services nationwide in the United States and make borrowing money as easy as ordering a pizza.
